## 🏏 IPL Match Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) match data to uncover meaningful insights about team performance, match outcomes, venues, and seasonal trends. The goal is to use data-driven techniques to understand historical IPL patterns and support better decision-making in sports analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the IPL dataset.

Analyze team performance across seasons.

Identify teams with the most wins and qualifications.

Study close matches and match margins.

Analyze venue popularity and seasonal match trends.

Visualize key insights using charts and graphs.
